Part A :
Predition：The number decreases from nine to one
result：
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Modify 1 ：
count = 9
while (count != 0):
    count -= 1
    print(count)
result：
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
0
Explanation:
In the original code, print(count) happens before count -= 1, so the first value printed is 9.

In the modified code, count -= 1 happens before print(count), so the first value printed is 8.

The output is different because the order of operations affects the value of count when it is printed.

Part B ：

# Function to get the suffix for a number
def get_suffix(n):
    if n % 10 == 1 and n != 11:
        return "st"
    elif n % 10 == 2 and n != 12:
        return "nd"
    elif n % 10 == 3 and n != 13:
        return "rd"
    else:
        return "th"

# Calculate and print the first 6 triangular numbers
triangular_number = 0
for i in range(1, 7):
    triangular_number += i
    print(f"The {i}{get_suffix(i)} triangular number is {triangular_number}")

The 1st triangular number is 1
The 2nd triangular number is 3
The 3rd triangular number is 6
The 4th triangular number is 10
The 5th triangular number is 15
The 6th triangular number is 21
