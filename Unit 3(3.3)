Predictions:

A: The nested loops print each row's elements separated by spaces. The output will be:

3 4 1 2 6 
9 2 3 7 5 
4 2 1 0 3 
B: Printing ar2 directly displays the 2D list structure. The output will be:

python
[[3, 4, 1, 2, 6], [9, 2, 3, 7, 5], [4, 2, 1, 0, 3]]
Modified Code:
To compute row sums and print them as 16, 26, 10:

python
ar2 = [[3, 4, 1, 2, 6],
       [9, 2, 3, 7, 5],
       [4, 2, 1, 0, 3]]

# Calculate sums of each row
sums = [sum(row) for row in ar2]

# Print the sums in the desired format
print(sums)
Output: [16, 26, 10]
