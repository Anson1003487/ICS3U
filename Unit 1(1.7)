Predict outputs for inputs x=6, y=3 and x=6, y=5.

x = int(input("Please input a whole number between 1 and 20: "))
if x < 1 or x > 20:
    print(f"{x} is outside of range. Cannot continue.")
else:
    y = int(input("Please input another whole number between 1 and 20: "))
    if y < 1 or y > 20:
        print(f"{y} is outside of range. Cannot continue.")
    else:
        if y != 0:
            rem = x % y
            if rem == 0:
                print(f"Yes! {y} is a factor of {x}!")
            else:
                print(f"{y} is not a factor of {x}.")
        else:
            print("Error: y cannot be zero.")
