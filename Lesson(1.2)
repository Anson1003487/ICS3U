Predict:Print(24)
If we run this might just get the number 24

Inspect:

modify(1):
amount=24
print(amount)
print("Two dozen is: ", amount)
Compared to just print 24, it makes more sence to use varible.

modify(2):
amount=7*4
print("forty-two is: ", amount)
forty-two is:  28

modify(3)
amount = 8
amount = amount + 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)
The amount is:  9

amount = 8
amount+=1
print("The amount is: ", amount)
The amount is:  9

modify(4):
amount = 8
amount = amount * 2
print(amount)
16

amount = 8
amount*=2
print(amount)
16
