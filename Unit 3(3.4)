Task 1: Find Largest Number
Solution Code:

python
myList = [22, 16, 59, 67, 55, 84, 7, 91, 89, 48, 69, 30, 98, 28, 31]  

highest = myList[0]  
for num in myList:  
    if num > highest:  
        highest = num  
print(f"The largest number is: {highest}")  # Output: 98  

Task 2: Find Smallest Number
Modified Code:

python
smallest = myList[0]  
for num in myList:  
    if num < smallest:  
        smallest = num  
print(f"The smallest number is: {smallest}")  # Output: 7  

Task 3: Calculate Sum
Modified Code:

python
total = 0  
for num in myList:  
    total += num  
print(f"The sum is: {total}")  # Output: 794
